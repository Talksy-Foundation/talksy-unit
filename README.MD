> [!TIP]  
> Single Forwarding Unit for Talksy conferencing service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Early development stage can mix SFU and MCU  

Talksy Unit is a server for transmitting video and audio in real time using
WebRTC technologies. This SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) is designed to provide
high-quality video and audio conferencing, providing efficient and
scalable solution.

## Structure

### Webserver

The WebServer interface defines methods:

```go
type WebServer interface {
	statsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, room *sfu.Room)
	reader(conn *websocket.Conn, messageChan chan Request)
	clientHandler(isDebug bool, conn *websocket.Conn, messageChan chan Request, r *sfu.Room)
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> * `statsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, room *sfu.Room)`: This method handles the HTTP request for retrieving statistics of a room. It takes in the response writer, request, and a pointer to an `sfu.Room` object and writes the statistics as a JSON response.
> * `reader(conn *websocket.Conn, messageChan chan Request)`: This method reads messages from a WebSocket connection and sends them to a message channel. It takes a pointer to a `websocket.Conn` object and a channel of type `Request` as parameters. It runs in a loop until the context is cancelled and decodes incoming messages, sending them to the message channel.
> * `clientHandler(isDebug bool, conn *websocket.Conn, messageChan chan Request, r *sfu.Room)`: This method handles the WebSocket connection for a client. It takes a boolean flag for debugging, a pointer to a `websocket.Conn` object, a channel of type `Request`, and a pointer to an `sfu.Room` objectas parameters. It runs in a loop until the context is cancelled and handles incoming messages, performing actions based on the message type.

### Request

```go
type Request struct {
	Type string      `json:"type"`
	Data interface{} `json:"data"`
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Request struct in Go defines a structure that represents a request. 
> It has two fields: `Type` of type `string` and `Data` of type `interface{}`. The `Type` field is tagged with `json:"type"` to indicate that it should be serialized as "type" when the struct is marshaled to JSON. The `Data` field is also tagged with `json:"data"` to indicate that it should be serialized as "data". This struct is commonly used for representing requests in an API.


### Respose
``` go
type Respose struct {
	Status bool        `json:"status"`
	Type   string      `json:"type"`
	Data   interface{} `json:"data"`
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Respose is a Go struct that represents a response object. It has three fields:
> * `Status`: A boolean field that indicates the status of the response.
> * `Type`: A `string` field that represents the type of the response.
> * `Data`: An `interface{}` field that can hold any type of data. This field is typically used when the response data can be of various types.


### VAD

> [!NOTE]
> VAD is a data structure that represents a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) object. It contains the following fields:
> * `SSRC`: An unsigned 32-bit integer that represents a synchronization source identifier (SSRC). This is typically used in multimedia communication protocols like RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol).
> * `TrackID`: A `string` that represents the ID of a track. In the context of multimedia, a track can refer to an audio or video stream.
> * `StreamID`: A `string` that represents the ID of a stream. In the context of multimedia, a stream can refer to a collection of audio or video tracks.
> * `Packets`: A slice of `voiceactivedetector.VoicePacketData` objects. This suggests that the VAD struct is used to hold information about voice packets, likely used in the context of voice activity detection.

```go
type VAD struct {
	SSRC     uint32                                `json:"ssrc"`
	TrackID  string                                `json:"track_id"`
	StreamID string                                `json:"stream_id"`
	Packets  []voiceactivedetector.VoicePacketData `json:"packets"`
}
```

### AvailableTrack

> [!NOTE]
> AvailableTrack is a struct that represents a track that is available for a client in a system.
	It has the following fields:
>* `ClientID` (string): The ID of the client that owns the track.
>* `ClientName` (string): The name of the client that owns the track.
>* `TrackID` (string): The ID of the track.
>* `StreamID` (string): The ID of the stream that the track belongs to.
>* `Source` (string): The source of the track.

```go
type AvailableTrack struct {
	ClientID   string `json:"client_id"`
	ClientName string `json:"client_name"`
	TrackID    string `json:"track_id"`
	StreamID   string `json:"stream_id"`
	Source     string `json:"source"`
}
```


## Features
### Trickle ICE
Trickle ICE is the process of sharing addresses as soon as they are gathered. This parallelizes establishing a connection with a remote peer and starting sessions with TURN servers. Using Trickle ICE can dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to establish a WebRTC connection.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Trickle ICE isn't mandatory to use, but highly recommended.

![ICE](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/611350196-56fc3656cd8c8fa580d154012b92e26edb9e7fcda4fcd53f9cc4ce04d1a22adf-d)

### Re-negotiation

> [!TIP]  
> Renegotiation in the Twenties WebRTC Represents Process Changes
> connection parameters between participants in a communication session. This may include
> includes adding or removing media streams, changing codecs, as well as
> security options such as the use of encryption.

The renegotiation process is usually initiated by one of the session participants,
who wants to make changes to the present connection. This can lead to
for various reasons such as adding a new component, changing
quality transfer or connection of a new device.

## Setup

### GitHub Personal Access Token

> ![NOTE]
> In order for Go to access the private repository, a Personal Access Token from GitHub will be needed. You can create an access token from the GitHub settings: https://github.com/settings/tokens. Give the token a description and select the “repo” scope.

### Configure Go with Personal Access Token
> ![NOTE]
> Once you have your access token, you’ll need to configure Go to use it when trying to access the private repository. You can do this by setting the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable to the hostname of the repository, and `GONOPROXY` variable to localhost. Finally set the global git config to use the token.

### Development:

Unix:
```sh
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/Talksy-Foundation/sfu
export GONOPROXY=localhost
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

Windows:
```sh
$Env:GOPRIVATE="github.com/Talksy-Foundation/sfu"
$Env:GONOPROXY="localhost"
$Env:GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your-token>"
```

```sh
git config --global url."https://$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN:x-oauth-basic@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"

go get github.com/Talksy-Foundation/sfu
# Paste <your-token> when password is requested
```

```bash
$Env:TURN_ENABLED="TRUE"
go run talksy_unit.go
```

1. Open the browser `http://localhost:8000/?room_id=1111` to open the client.
2. Click the Start button to start the WebRTC connection.
3. Open another browser tab `http://localhost:8000/?room_id=1111` to start a different client.
4. Click the Start button to start the WebRTC connection, you should see the video stream from the first client.
5. Repeat the steps above to add more clients.
6. Change `room_id` to create new room

```bash
docker build -t talksy-unit:1.0.0
docker run -p 8080:8000 -d talksy-unit:1.0.0
```
